# "fangis"; a well known game
## How it works
There are several ways of playing "fangis". Here is the classic way of playing.   
There are:   
- the Fänger
- the others   

The Fänger has to catch one of the other players, by touching them.   
The others try not to be caught by the Fänger.   
If one of the other players is caught, they become the Fänger, and the Fänger is therefore free.   

Additional rules:
- If there are a lot of players, it is recomended to play with several Fänger, to keep it interesting.

## Epic banana mode
If you choose this epic mode, an additional level of difficulty is added for all players:   
Players can drop bananas on the playgroud. When an other player runs into one of the bananas, they are punsihed:  
They are blocked for one second, while their character turns inplace.   
There is also the special pink banana, that nutralizes the player running into it for two seconds.     
Every player has several normal bananas, but only one special pink banana at their disposition for their game.
